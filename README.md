# 🏠 Real Estate Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a **Real Estate dataset** using **SQL** and **Power BI** to find meaningful insights about property prices, agents, and locations.  
The main goal is to understand how various factors like city, property type, area, and year built affect housing prices.

## 🧠 Key Insights from SQL Analysis
- **San Francisco** has the most affordable homes on average.  
- **Emily Davis** is the top agent with the lowest average days on market.  
- Properties built **after 2010** have the highest average prices.  
- Larger **lot sizes** generally lead to higher property values.  
- High-demand homes are those sold within **3 days** and above city-average price.
